# MallCustomerSegmentation
## Abstract
Stores usually launch offers, but how do they know what kind of offers could we need? 

Fortunately they're not spying us when we are talking or thinking about our necessities (or maybe yes). However, one of the many roads to discover deeper relationships between customer necessities and increase store sellings is by finding patterns into data, and that's what <b>Machine Learning</b> accomplishes when receiving it.

## Unsupervised learning
This <b>Machine Learning</b> subarea refers to the use of <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> algorithms to detect patterns in data sets containing data points that are neither classified nor labeled.

## Solution
In order to find groups of customers with common characteristics such as salary range or spending score proximity I will use a clustering algorithm known as <b>k-means</b>.

After that, I'll use a decision tree which implements the CART algorithm in order to finding specific boundaries to classify customers according to labels generated by the <b>k-means</b> algorithm.

### K-means

#### Interpretation of clusters by customer group
| label | Annual Income (k$) | Spending score (1-100) |
| ----- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
|  0游릭 |   intermediate     |  intermediate          |
|  1游리 |   low              |      high              |
|  2游댮 |   high             |      low               |
|  3游릮 |   low              |      low               |
|  4游댯 |   high             |      high              |

### Decision tree

<p>Value it's an array of label values from 0-4. So according to image 3, it can be undestood in the following way:</p>
<p>value = [ label0游릭, label1游리, label2游댮, label3游릮, label4游댯 ]</p>
